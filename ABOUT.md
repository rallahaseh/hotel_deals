## Why Python ?

Because from the first time I heard about it and how does use it and the useful usage of it and the support community it has I was surprised and when I was reading some articles about TensorFlow and other machine learning libraries and how the developers love using it. I was waiting the moment or the motivation to break the ice and start learning it as soon as possible and as a technical side, I supposed to archive the following part which I liked.

"The biggest strength of Python is that everybody can use it. I have searched through the web and found a lot of companies that have reviewed, thoroughly tested production code thatâ€™s widely used in live trading. Also have scrappy experiments, one-off scripts that are thrown away after being run. And all of them admit that Python is great for both scenarios.

Previously, research on models would be done in  [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), and the model would be rewritten in Java for production. This will present a number of challenges.

By using Python everywhere, you can easily  **facilitate communication between teams**. Anyone can run an experiment using the same code that runs in production."

## Problem [Updated Problem Fixed]

For some resone Herokue could not read the **requirements.txt** file which is response for the dependencies of the project so [requests library](https://github.com/requests/requests) could not be included.

## Process

First time using Django, so I tried the function based views and then I discovered how classes work and reimplement them and continue implementing the GET/POST requests that will be handled through the web-page.

Okay so we got a strict development cycle here.
1. Receive JSON data from API
2. Add default value params for orchestrator
3. Add optional params if entered
4. Update the request and the response
5. Deploy with **Heroku**
6. Add repository to **Travis-ci**

## General

Well, the task let me finally began my journey with Python. Because Python is one of the programming languages that is easy to use, powerful and versatile, making a great choice for beginners and experts in various engineering fields.

A programming framework is a toolkit of components needed to create a web or mobile application. Django is a more fully featured kit than most of other frameworks, it contains everything you need to build an app.


Can't wait to start playing with tensor-flow libraries :P
