## Why Python ?

The biggest strength of Python is that everybody can use it. I have searched through the web and found a lot of companies that have reviewed, thoroughly tested production code thatâ€™s widely used in live trading. Also have scrappy experiments, one-off scripts that are thrown away after being run. And all of them admit that Python is great for both scenarios.

Previously, research on models would be done in  [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), and the model would be rewritten in Java for production. This will present a number of challenges.

By using Python everywhere, you can easily  **facilitate communication between teams**. Anyone can run an experiment using the same code that runs in production.

## Problem

For some resone Herokue could not read the **requirements.txt** file which is response for the dependencies of the project so [requests library](https://github.com/requests/requests) could not be included.

## Process

First time using Django, so I tried the function based views and then I discovered how classes work and reimplement them and continue implementing the GET/POST requests that will be handled through the web-page.

Okay so we got a strict development cycle here.
1. Receive JSON data from API
2. Add default value params for orchestrator
3. Add optional params if entered
4. Update the request and the response

## General

Well, the task let me finally began my journey with Python. Because Python is one of the programming languages that is easy to use, powerful and versatile, making a great choice for beginners and experts in various engineering fields.

A programming framework is a toolkit of components needed to create a web or mobile application. Django is a more fully featured kit than most of other frameworks, it contains everything you need to build an app.


Can't wait to start playing with tensor-flow libraries :P
